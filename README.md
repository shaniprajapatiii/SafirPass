# SafirPass

## AI-Powered Smart Tourist Digital Identity, Safety & Incident Response System

SafirPass is a privacy-first digital identity and emergency response platform designed for international tourists. It helps travelers verify their identity, share only the information required by service providers, and trigger fast emergency assistance when needed.

The platform combines:
- digital identity verification
- consent-based selective disclosure
- emergency SOS reporting
- location-aware authority response dashboards
- secure, real-time tourist support workflows

---

## Overview

SafirPass gives tourists a safer alternative to handing over physical passports in hotels, transport hubs, rental agencies, and embassies. Instead of exposing full identity documents, the system verifies a tourist’s identity and shares only necessary attributes such as name, validity period, nationality, or stay details.

This project is built with Next.js, Neon Serverless Postgres, and MongoDB Atlas, and it includes:
- authentication with Google OAuth and email-based sign in
- profile and KYC data management
- QR-based selective disclosure flows
- consent request approval and denial handling
- SOS alert creation and command center tracking
- geofence and incident visibility

---

## Key Features

### Tourist Experience
- Secure account creation and sign-in
- Digital identity verification workflow
- Passport and visa verification records
- Selective disclosure of personal details
- Offline-safe credential generation and QR sharing
- Emergency SOS trigger with geolocation

### Authority & Response Panels
- Dashboard for traveler, consent, and verification status
- Emergency command console for SOS triage
- Safety geofence visibility
- Real-time alert dispatch telemetry

### Privacy & Security
- Attribute-based sharing instead of raw passport exposure
- Session management with JWT and HTTP-only cookies
- Google OAuth integration
- Parameterized SQL protection via Neon Serverless Postgres
- Dual-layer storage with MongoDB Atlas Document Vault
- Minimal data sharing by default

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm 10 or newer
- Git
- A Neon Serverless Postgres project (or PostgreSQL database)
- A MongoDB Atlas database
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth credentials

---

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/safir_pass.git
cd safir_pass
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill the values:

```bash
copy .env.example .env.local
```

Then update the file with your values:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ep-example-123.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/SafirPass?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
JWT_SECRET="your-long-random-secret"
```

### 4. Create your PostgreSQL database

In Neon Console SQL Editor, run the SQL from:

```bash
database/neon_schema.sql
```

This creates:
- profiles
- kyc_applications
- consent_requests
- sos_alerts
- geofences

### 5. Set up Google OAuth

In Google Cloud Console:
1. Create or select a project.
2. Enable Google Identity / OAuth.
3. Create an OAuth client ID.
4. Add authorized redirect URI:
   - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
5. Copy the client ID and secret into your `.env.local` file.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, designers, testers, and community members.

### 1. Fork the repository

```bash
git fork https://github.com/<your-username>/safir_pass.git
```

Or create a fork from GitHub UI and then clone it locally.

### 2. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use a clear branch name such as:
- feature/google-auth-improvement
- fix/sos-dashboard-bug
- chore/update-readme
- docs/setup-guide

### 3. Make changes

- Keep code clear and readable
- Follow existing project patterns
- Avoid breaking the app structure
- Update documentation when changing setup or workflows

### 4. Validate locally

Run the relevant checks before opening a PR:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### 5. Commit your work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add tourist verification workflow"
```

Use commit messages that are clear and conventional, for example:
- feat: add new dashboard section
- fix: correct auth redirect issue
- docs: improve contributor setup guide
- chore: update dependency versions

### 6. Push and open a PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub and include:

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and small
- Prefer clear, maintainable code
- Add comments only when they improve clarity
- Test your work before submitting
- Respect the project’s privacy-first security standards
- Do not expose secrets, API keys, or credentials in commits

---

## Environment Security

Never commit:
- .env.local files
- production API secrets
- Supabase service role keys
- OAuth client secrets

Use `.env.local` for local development only and keep all secrets in a secure environment.
